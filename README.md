Robot game application in C++

In this game, there is a player robot and 3 opponent robots in a maze environment. The player robot wins the game if it can collect 100 things without dying. The player robot dies when it hits another robot or a wall boundary. Opponent robots move randomly and drops random number of things on the cells as they move. They will be resurrected immediately when they dies. More details and a demo executable of this game can be found in the attached homework zip document.

I modified a class by adding new member functions and private data member.
